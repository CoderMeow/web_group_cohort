# Lesson 11

### This Lesson's Focus: Learn AJAX *(continued)*
In the last lesson, there were some challenges on the Cake Website that let you dynamically fill in
the content of your website from a json file. In production or on a normal website, a json file
is not stored on the front-end. You will use something called AJAX to request the necessary json
data from the backend. Then you can use that data to fill in the content on your site.


### Course Work

#### Assignment: Learn AJAX
**Read:** To give you a little introduction to AJAX, read this nicely laid out blog post. It's a
*simple* and *quick* read to prep you for the beginning of the CodeSchool AJAX course.

**Take Course:** All you need to complete the CodeSchool project below is the *FIRST LEVEL* of this course.
But if you feel inclined to take more while you are in there... go for it!

**Do:** CodeSchool has mini projects to help you apply what you learn on the way. They use GitHub to fork and clone projects just like we do! They even have a handy way to check your project (if you keep committing and then pushing to GitHub). The instructions are pretty good... if you get stuck, reach out to a mentor!
