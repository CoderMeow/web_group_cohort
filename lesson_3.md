#### Assignment: Need More Work? Want to Practice More HTML/CSS  
**Do**: Start working on your Cat Project!  

1) Should have forked and cloned this project from GitHub during CoderGirl, but if you haven't here is a link to the Project on GitHub: [GitHub Cat Project](https://github.com/LaunchCoderGirlSTL/web_group_project_1)

2) Link the CSS File to your HTML: [Link CSS in HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_link.asp). Make sure you put in the correct "source path" to your css file. It is a local path (which we talked about at CoderGirl)

3) Code the HTML and CSS - here are the design files: [Cat Project Design Files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9ILOB0VrUJ5ODFvVTdhRWZiaHc?usp=sharing). Make sure you start with the Desktop Version. We will be learning responsive design later.
