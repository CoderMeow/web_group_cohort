#### Assignment: Project 2 - Cake Project
**Do**: *Setup project 2* - Fork & Clone the repository located here:  
[Project 2 - Cake Project](https://github.com/LaunchCoderGirlSTL/web_group_project_2)

**Do**: *Setup file structure* - For this project, we did not create an html file or a css file. So after you make a local copy of the project on your computer (with git clone), your first step is to create an index.html file and a main.css file. You can follow the same folder structure as the Kat project (css folder holds your css file, etc). Below are some resources to help you:  
[HTML Structure Shell](https://www.sitepoint.com/a-minimal-html-document-html5-edition/)  
[Help on Linking CSS file to HTML](https://teamtreehouse.com/community/htmlcss-linking)  

**Do**: *Code Index Page* - Start coding the index page of the Cake Project. Pick one thing on the page to work on and start coding. That could be the just the nav bar, the footer, or the Flexbox layout. Remember to use git as you are working. Plan to do one thing, for example style the nav bar, code it, git add it, git commit it. Then plan the next thing and repeat.


#### Bored?!
