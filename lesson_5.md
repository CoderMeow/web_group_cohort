#### Assignment: Read More About "Good" Code
**Read**: You don't have to really read every word of this article, but definitely go through each example and think about what makes the code bad vs good.  
[Shay Howe - Good Code](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)

**Do**: After going through the article, clean up your Cat Project html and css files and get that code looking EXCELLENT. We will be PEER REVIEWING the code in class next week.


#### Assignment: Learn Responsive Web Skills
**Do**: Complete the CodeSchool responsive web class, Journey Into Mobile.

#### Assignment: Make Your Cat Project Responsive  
**Do**: Now that you know how to make your web pages responsive, apply what you have learned to your Cat Project. There is a Mobile design image in the designs folder. By the time you are done, your cat project should look like the Desktop Version on Large Screens and the Mobile Version on small screens.   

The design files are located in your project file (find the design folder in web_group_project_1 repo on your computer) or you can view them [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9ILOB0VrUJ5ODFvVTdhRWZiaHc?usp=sharing) on GoogleDrive. Make sure you start with the Desktop Version. We will be learning responsive design later to code the mobile version.
