### Course Work

#### Assignment: Keep Learning HTML/CSS
**Do**: CodeSchool has some great HTML/CSS Courses if you feel like you need a more solid HTML/CSS foundation. I would recommend just taking CSS Cross-Country, if you completed the Khan Academy Course:  
[CodeSchool - Front-end Foundations](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/front-end-foundations)  
[CodeSchool - Front-end Formations](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/front-end-formations)  
[CodeSchool - CSS Cross-Country](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/css-cross-country)  

#### Assignment: Build Cat Project  
**Do**: Work on Your Cat Project!  
Code the HTML and CSS - The design files are located in your project file (find the design folder in web_group_project_1 repo on your computer) or you can view them [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9ILOB0VrUJ5ODFvVTdhRWZiaHc?usp=sharing) on GoogleDrive. Make sure you start with the Desktop Version. We will be learning responsive design later to code the mobile version.
