#### Assignment: Paint A Box - a Javascript and jQuery Challenge
**Do**: Sick of taking CodeSchool class after CodeSchool class? Complete this challenge for a break. There are TODO comments written in the JS code for each task that you need to complete. To get started, create a CodePen account (if you haven't already), Fork the project (by clicking the button), and start coding. Don't forget to Save every once in a while. Good luck!

*Side Note: In one task you need to use a javascript conditional. If you haven't take the 2nd Javascript class yet, no worries! You have already learned the comparison operator, ==, and can use this handy resource to get the proper syntax for a conditional:

#### Assignment: Project 2 - Cake Project *(continued)*
**Do**: Keep working on the Cake project... if you haven't noticed, there are a lot of pages. Remember to use git as you are working. Plan to do one thing, for example style the nav bar, code it, git add it, git commit it. Then plan the next thing and repeat.
