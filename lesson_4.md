# Lesson 4

### This Lesson's Focus: Apply HTML/CSS Knowledge, Build Cat Project
* <i>continue:</i> Learning HTML/CSS
* Build Cat Project


### At CoderGirl
* Quick Talk - Visualizing Your Repository with GitK
* Setting Up CodeSchool Accounts
* Work Day
* Activity - Setting Up Your Cat Project (if you haven't already, see below)

#### Activity - Setting Up Your Cat Project (if you haven't already)
1) Create a Project Folder: navigate to GitHub Folder (I believe it is located in your Documents Folder. Once there create a Folder to hold your project with the name project_1_cat_costumes (using underscores instead of spaces will help later when we are using the command line).

2) Setup the Project Files: you are now going to setup your HTML and CSS files, but File Structure is important! Keeping things organized is not usually necessary for smaller project but it is good practice. When you start doing bigger projects, having a good folder structure is good for knowing where to locate things.

3) Make Your Project a Git Repository
Open your terminalâ€¦ and navigate to the project you just created (your pwd should look like this: something/project_1_cat_costumes). Now run the [git init](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init) command to make this project a git project so you can version control it.

That is it! You are ready to start working on this project. Later we will add this project to your Github account.


### Course Work

#### Assignment: Build Cat Project  
**Do**: Work on Your Cat Project!  

1) Link the CSS File to your HTML: [Link CSS in HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_link.asp). Make sure you put in the correct "source path" to your css file. It is a local path (which we talked about at CoderGirl)

2) Code the HTML and CSS - here are the design files: [Cat Project Design Files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9ILOB0VrUJ5ODFvVTdhRWZiaHc?usp=sharing). Make sure you start with the Desktop Version. We will be learning responsive design later.

#### Assignment: Keep Learning HTML/CSS
**Do**: CodeSchool has some great HTML/CSS Courses if you feel like you need a more solid HTML/CSS foundation.
I would recommend just taking CSS Cross-Country, if you completed the Khan Academy Course:  
[CodeSchool - Front-end Foundations](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/front-end-foundations)  
[CodeSchool - Front-end Formations](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/front-end-formations)
