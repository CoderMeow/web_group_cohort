### Course Work

#### Assignment: Build Cat Project  
**Do**: Work on Your Cat Project!  

1) Link the CSS File to your HTML: [Link CSS in HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_link.asp). Make sure you put in the correct "source path" to your css file. It is a local path (which we talked about at CoderGirl)

2) Code the HTML and CSS - here are the design files: [Cat Project Design Files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9ILOB0VrUJ5ODFvVTdhRWZiaHc?usp=sharing). Make sure you start with the Desktop Version. We will be learning responsive design later.

#### Assignment: Keep Learning HTML/CSS
**Do**: CodeSchool has some great HTML/CSS Courses if you feel like you need a more solid HTML/CSS foundation.
I would recommend just taking CSS Cross-Country, if you completed the Khan Academy Course:
[CodeSchool - Front-end Foundations](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/front-end-foundations)
[CodeSchool - Front-end Formations](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/front-end-formations)
