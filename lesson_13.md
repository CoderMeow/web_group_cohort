# Lesson 13

### This Lesson's Focus: Start Learning React
React is a Javascript Framework.

### Course Work

#### Assignment: Learn about newer Javascript Syntax
**Do:** The React Framework uses some newer javascript frameworks. In order to understand the React syntax better, take this CodeSchool course on JS ES2015.

#### Assignment: Practice ES2015 Syntax
Remember that class list demo we did in class... To demonstrate "Object-Oriented" Javascript programming, we quickly coded a Student class. Then used that student class to list organize and list out all the students in a class. You can see where we left off:

**Do**: Now you are going to "re-code" this mini project with the new ES2015 syntax you learned in the CodeSchool Course above. One Problem... modern browsers can't read ES2015 yet... so you need a special compiler to pre-compile the code into normal JS so the browser can read it. [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is one of those compilers. But luckily, JSFiddle lets us configure a "playground" area on the web where you can practice writing ES2015 without having to setup a whole development environment. I set one up for you to use... Check it out:

**Your Goal**: to change the Student class from the Class List Demo into an ES2015 class... and feel free to add some css... make it pretty... make it better... add more functionality (like another class Professor?)... go crazy.

#### Assignment: Take a React Course
**Do:** Now you are ready to start learning React.
