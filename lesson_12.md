Add the following new feature to the Cat Lady Scale project.

**Feature 1 - The Scale**  
In the picture above you will notice a scale displayed below the "Your Current Cat Lady Status" section. Add this scale to your project. As the user's cat lady status changes move the colored dot and the bolded text to reflect the current cat lady scale status.

**Feature 2 - The Scale Hover**  
Now that your new scale is in place, when the user hovers over a scale circle, display the title of the corresponding status object. For example, if a user hovered over the 7 circle, you would display "A One-Cat Kind of Human" in a little pop-up.

**Feature 3 - Change of Cat Lady Behavior List**  
Change the Cat Lady Behaviors List to display all the behavior options as items. Users can now check the box to "add behaviors" and uncheck the box to "remove behaviors". This will take a lot of code changing but I believe in you!

**Feature 4 - Bonus**  
Have an idea for a cool new feature. Add it and show a mentor!
